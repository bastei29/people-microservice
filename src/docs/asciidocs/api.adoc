|===
| Status code | Usage

 The actual response will depend on the request method used. + 
 In a GET request, the response will contain an entity corresponding to the requested resource.

| `201 Created`
| The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created. + 
 The actual response will depend on the request method used. + 
 In a POST request, the response will contain a location describing the new resource.

| `204 No Content`
| The server successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content.

| `400 Bad Request`
| The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).
  
| `401 Unauthorized`
| The provided authentication information isn't matching and the requested resource cannot be accessed.

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource could not be found but may be available again in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible.

| The content-type from the request accept header could not be matched on a resource.
