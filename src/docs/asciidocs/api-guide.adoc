 The actual response will depend on the request method used. + 
 In a GET request, the response will contain an entity corresponding to the requested resource.

| The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created. + 
 The actual response will depend on the request method used. +

| `204 No Content`
| The server successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content.

| `400 Bad Request`
